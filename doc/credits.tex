In the process of writing this report, we discovered that \(\texttt{vga-sim}\)
by ZipCPU \cite{vgasimzip} implements a similar Verilator based approach. We had
already developed our own system with great difficulty and dozens of cycles of 
trial and error for achieving the same goal by the time we discovered it. Their
software, offered as both an open-source and commercial product, is vastly superior 
in terms of raw display capability, and is very well written. Having a similar 
original model, we decided not to switch despite possible performance gains, as well
as for other reasons, notably it not implementing an input system similar to ours.
We have not had a chance to fully explore its display capabilities due to time
constraints, but we would recommend it wholeheartedly. Despite the troubles,
it was a great experience for us, so we are proud of our flawed system.
We felt they still deserved credit here for developing the technology, and we hope
less people in the future in similar proedicaments will miss this software, 
for the hard work of the people at ZipCPU, as well as the sanity of they
who try to implement it themselves \(\textsf{;)}\)
