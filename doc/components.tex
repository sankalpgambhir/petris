The physical components to develop this project would be 
\begin{itemize}
    \item An FPGA
    \item A VGA Display
    \item A DAC to feed the output of the FPGA to the VGA
    \item Buttons to control the inputs 
    \item A laptop with the Intel Quartus software and the required connecters. 
\end{itemize}}
We would expect this to be somewhat easier as we would only have to focus on the game logic and the I/O should
 be substantially simpler.
